  Hello I am Mehmet Şamil BÜYÜKÇAĞLAYAN and I am starting to learn new programming language which is created by Yukihiro Matsumoto.
Ruby is a Object oriented language and it is legibility. If you know English you can understand easily. For example
`10.times.puts("Hello World!")`. it prints  10 times 'Hello World!'.In another example `a = "hello" \\ a.upcase`.It makes 
letters uppercase. Unlike some other languages it is interpreted language.It means it can work until wrong code and it makes finding 
problem easier.And also programmer can explain him self to computer with it I'm gonna tell other good things when its turns come.
