Hello after a long time later. Now I'm gonna talk about a new gem about Web Developing on ruby. Almost every developer heard that gem. In this post I'm gonna write about Ruby on Rails. Rails is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language. David Heinemeier Hansson is its creator. He gave it the name “Ruby on Rails,” though it is often just called “Rails.”

It is software code that is added to the Ruby programming language. Technically, it is a package library (specifically, a RubyGem), that is installed using the operating system command-line interface. And also this gem is make easier creating new project with other gems. After last my hashes post I will continue this developping way with Rails. That's all. See you on new post :D.
