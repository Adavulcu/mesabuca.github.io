Hello everyone this post will be about MVC. MVC is a design pattern. MVC (Model-Views-Controller) is getting easier comminication between user and site. 
<br>
Firstly Controller is looking for actions and want some datas from model. Secondly model is asking to data-base for datas.And then when controller get the datas, it is processing on datas. Lastly views show us what we want.

That's all for now see you on next post.
