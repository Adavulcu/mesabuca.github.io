Hello every one in this post I'm gonna talk about Semantic Versioning (semver). This versioning style is making easier improving your project. Improvable projects, day by day getting more bigger but controlling is getting more difficult because of that Semver founded. There are three number on this versioning <br>
1. Major <br>
2. Minor <br>
3. Patch <br>
Patch : If you found and fix a bug, when you are releasing you should increase one, but it had to be backwards-compatible <br>
Minor : If you wanna add some little new features you should increase one here, but again!! it had to be backwards-compatible. And when you increase this part the patch had to be reset.
<br>
Major : When you change your project like when you are makeing incompatible API changes you're increasin here, but id had not to be backwards-compatible. And when you increase this part the patch and minor had to be reset.
<br>
See you on my next post.
