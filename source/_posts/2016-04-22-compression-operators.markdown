    Operators		Description										                                Example
 
    '=='	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not,					            (a == b) is not true. 
     		 if yes then condition becomes true.
 
    '!='	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not,			            		(a != b) is true. 
     		 if values are not equal then condition becomes true.
 
    '>'		Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand,		(a > b) is not true. 
     		if yes then condition becomes true.
 
    '<'		Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand,		(a < b) is true. 
     	if yes then condition becomes true.
 
    '>='	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right	(a >= b) is not true. 
     		operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
 
    '<='	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right		(a <= b) is true.
    	    operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
 
    '<=>'	Combined comparison operator. Returns 0 if first operand equals second, 1 if first	(a <=> b) returns -1. 
    	    operand is greater than the second and -1 if first operand is less than the second.
 
    '==='	Used to test equality within a when clause of a case statement.				        (1...10) === 5 returns true.
