  If you want to use a method you should write it with dat '.' after which you want to use on. For example 
-- a = "Ruby" \\ a.reverse -- Its output will be 'ybuR'. Hence the name it is reversing the words. If you want to use more than one method
you should use dat '.' between of the methods. For example `a = "limas"` `a.reverse.capitalize`
And here is some methods with means : 

```ruby
gets            # getting a integer or string or anything
chomp           # when yo enter a space character it cleans that spaces
capitalize      # Its make capitalize the word's first character
upcase          # Its make capitalize all words
downcase        # Its make small all character
reverse         # It Ä±s reversing words but only strings.
to_s            # Its converting to strings
to_i            # Its converting to integer
to_a            # Its converting to array
each	        # Processing each variable in arrays
split           # it takes in a string and returns an array.
to_sym          # it convert to symbol and using symbol faster than string
```
