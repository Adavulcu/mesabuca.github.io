You can compare somethings with each other with control flow. For example :
```ruby
grade = 50

if grade < 50
  puts "You could not pass the exam"
else
  puts "You pass the exam"
end

# or

unless grade > 50
  puts "You could not pass the exam"
else
  puts "You pass the exam"
end
```

when you get over 50, it will say you pass.
